# Parser of Pascal
This is a part of my course project of Compiler Construction. The
original version is given by Professor R. M. Siegfried.

In the first part, we are asked to build a scanner which could scan a Pascal program file and return the coresponding tokens. 
At this stage, the symbol table is not required. 

The second step is to build a symbol table manager. And Now I'm working on this.
(Still try to explore the features of github)
